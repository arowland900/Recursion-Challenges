## DAY 1:
- Write a recursive JavaScript function to calculate the factorial of a number.
- In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120 

---
## DAY 2:
- Write a recursive JavaScript function to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two positive numbers.

---
## DAY 3:
- Write a recursive JavaScript function to get the integers in range (x, y).

```
Example : range(2, 9)
Expected Output : [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
