## DAY 1:
- Write a recursive JavaScript function to calculate the factorial of a number.
- In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. For example, 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120 

---
## DAY 2:
- Write a recursive JavaScript function to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two positive numbers.

---
## DAY 3:
- Write a recursive JavaScript function to get the integers in range (x, y).

```
Example : range(2, 9)
Expected Output : [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

---
## DAY 4:
- Write a recursive JavaScript function to compute the sum of an array of integers.

```
Example : var array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Expected Output : 21 
```

---
## DAY 5:
- Write a recursive JavaScript function that takes in two arguments: a number `num`, and an exponent `exp`.  The function should return `num` to the power of `exp`.

```
Example : `num` = 8, `exp` = 2
Expected Output : 64
```

---
## DAY 6:
- Write a recursive JavaScript function to get the first n Fibonacci numbers.

```
Example : `n` = 6
Expected Output : [ 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
```

---
## DAY 7: 
- Write a recursive JavaScript function to check whether or not a number is even

```
Example : `n` = 6
Expected Output : true
```

---
## DAY 8:
- Write a recursive JavaScript function for binary search.
